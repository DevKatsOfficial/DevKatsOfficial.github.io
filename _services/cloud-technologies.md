## Cloud Technology VS Traditional Technology
It has always been very expensive and complex to follow those old traditional business applications. The innumerable software solutions in the market, how to work on them, or how to make them function properly is a continuous intimidating problem. For it, you need a group of experts to run, install, test, update and configure those old softwares.

That is the reasons, top IT firms who are working on latest business applications, do not go for those old methods and tools. Therefore small and medium businesses do not stand a chance in front of them because they are still confused in those traditional Software.
